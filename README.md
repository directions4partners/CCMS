# CCMS — Cloud Customer Management System

**CCMS (Cloud Customer Management System)** is an open-source Business Central app designed to revolutionize how partners manage and support their customers. Built collaboratively by a consortium of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central partners, CCMS provides a secure, modular, and automated way to handle the entire lifecycle of customer environments — dramatically reducing the need for direct access and manual intervention.

## 📌 Project Vision

In a cloud-first world, partners should not need to log into customer environments for everyday maintenance tasks.  
**CCMS aims to make that a reality.**

By centralizing critical management functions into a single, extensible Business Central app, CCMS empowers partners to deliver more secure, scalable, and consistent service while maintaining strong customer trust and compliance.

## 🧭 Design Principles

CCMS is built on a set of guiding principles derived from the partner community:

- 🧩 **Modular by design** — Each capability is implemented as a standalone building block. Partners can adopt the entire system or only the parts they need.
- ☁️ **Cloud-native and future-proof** — CCMS focuses exclusively on cloud deployments and will not support on-premises scenarios.
- 🔐 **Security-first** — All features must follow secure-by-default principles, including proper logging, monitoring, and permission models.
- 📊 **Actionable insight, not data hoarding** — We collect and store only what’s necessary to operate and improve customer environments.
- 🤝 **Partner-centric** — The solution is built for and with partners, enabling them to manage customers as they grow — and manage themselves like customers, too.
- 🪶 **Simplicity over complexity** — Every feature should add clear value. Over-complication is considered a bug.

## 🚀 Key Objectives

- 🔧 **Minimize direct access** — Enable partners to manage customers without logging into production environments except in rare, exceptional circumstances.
- 🛠️ **Automate routine tasks** — Streamline provisioning, configuration, updates, license tracking, test environments, and lifecycle operations.
- 🔐 **Improve security and compliance** — Reduce the operational and regulatory risks of environment access.
- 🤝 **Enable collaboration** — Provide a common, open foundation built by and for the partner ecosystem.
- 📈 **Scalable and extensible** — Designed to integrate with partner processes, third-party solutions, and Microsoft APIs.

## 🧭 Core Features (Planned)

While CCMS is under active development, its roadmap focuses on delivering a comprehensive partner management platform, including:

- **Customer Overview** — A unified view of all customer environments, apps, versions, PTEs, and storage usage.
- **Change History & Audit** — Track what changed, when, and why — including app installs, updates, and configuration modifications.
- **Automated Maintenance Workflows** — Tasks like environment refresh, permission resets, AppSource updates, and PTE lifecycle operations.
- **Monitoring & Health Checks** — Job queue tracking, storage capacity warnings, database growth predictions, and system health dashboards.
- **Test Environment Automation** — Spawn test environments and run customer-recorded test scripts.
- **Partner Self-Service Tools** — Provide partner-centric views, similar to how customers manage their own environments.

> 💡 CCMS is evolving rapidly. See the [project board](https://github.com/directions4partners/ccms/issues) for upcoming features and milestones.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

CCMS is implemented as a **Business Central extension (AL)** and is designed to integrate seamlessly with Microsoft’s cloud services. Its modular design enables partners to extend the solution with their own logic, connectors, or business rules.

High-level components include:

- **Core Extension** — The foundation app deployed into partner-managed environments.
- **API Layer** — Integrations with Microsoft Admin APIs, telemetry services, and third-party systems.
- **Workflow Engine** — Extensible automation for maintenance tasks.
- **UI Modules** — Role-based pages and dashboards for partners and service teams.

## 📉 Out of Scope

CCMS deliberately avoids certain areas to stay focused and deliver real value:

- ❌ **On-premises support** — CCMS is a cloud-only solution.
- ❌ **Backend lock-in** — It will not be tied to a specific DevOps or CI/CD platform.
- ❌ **Unnecessary data retention** — We will not collect or store telemetry that doesn’t serve a clear operational purpose.
- ❌ **Over-engineering** — We will prioritize simplicity and usability over excessive configurability.
