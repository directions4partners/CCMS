We follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure to protect our users.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Email: **freddy@directions4partners.com**

  - Affected versions and environments
  - Any suggested mitigations

**Do not** file public GitHub issues for suspected vulnerabilities.

## Our Process

1. **Acknowledgement** — We aim to acknowledge new reports within **3 business days**.
2. **Triage** — Reproduce, assess severity, and determine affected scope.
3. **Fix** — Develop and test a fix; prepare release notes and CVE request if applicable.
4. **Coordinated Disclosure** — We will propose a disclosure timeline (typically **7–30 days** depending on severity) and publish advisories after patches are available.
