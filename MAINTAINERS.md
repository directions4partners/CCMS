# CCMS Maintainers

This document defines maintainer responsibilities, how maintainers are added/removed, and how we run elections after the Bootstrap Period.

**Repository:** https://github.com/directions4partners/ccms

---

## 1) Responsibilities

Maintainers are stewards of the project. They are expected to:

- Review PRs in their areas; ensure tests/docs, quality, and alignment with project goals
- Triage issues; label, prioritize, and close as appropriate
- Participate in design discussions and release planning
- Enforce Code of Conduct and uphold community guidelines
- Help grow contributors (mentorship, “good first issue”, docs)
- Maintain CI health and contribute to automation where possible

---

## 2) Areas & Ownership

We use `CODEOWNERS` to map files/directories to owners. Owners are the default reviewers and approvers for those areas. Cross-cutting changes may require multiple owners.

---

## 3) Becoming a Maintainer

**Nomination:** Any existing maintainer may nominate a contributor. Self-nominations are welcome.

**Eligibility:** Anyone with **significant contributions** (see §5 of `GOVERNANCE.md`). This includes sustained code, docs, reviews, design, triage, release, infra, or community work.

**Confirmation:** The TSC confirms new maintainers by **simple majority vote**. Upon confirmation, the contributor is granted merge/review rights and added to `MAINTAINERS.md` and `CODEOWNERS` as appropriate.

---

## 4) Inactivity, Pauses, and Removal

- **Inactivity:** Maintainers with no meaningful activity for **6+ months** may be moved to **Emeritus** by TSC vote (simple majority). Emeritus maintainers retain recognition but no merge rights.
- **Voluntary pause:** A maintainer may request temporary inactivity; their status may be preserved.
- **Removal for cause:** Repeated violations of the Code of Conduct or negligence may result in removal by **2/3 TSC vote** after a documented warning.

---

## 5) TSC Elections (Post-Bootstrap)

- **TSC Size:** 7 seats total; **1 permanent seat** for **Directions for Partners** (appointed by the CEO of Directions for Partners) and **6 elected seats**.
- **Voters:** Maintainers with significant contributions **and** current TSC members.
- **Candidates:** Any maintainer with significant contributions may stand for election.
- **Doubt about eligibility:** Resolved by **simple majority of the current TSC**.
- **Terms:** 18 months, renewable.
- **Method:** Ranked-choice or simple majority (announced with the election).
